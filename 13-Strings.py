#Using python to manipulate string
'''
Python can be used to manipulate strings, which can 
be expressed in several ways.

They can be enclosed in single quotes ('...') 
or double quotes ("...")

'\' can be used to escape quotes

or triple quotes (""" ...
.
.
""")
Python strings cannot be changed â€” "they are immutable".
We will also look at the built in function called len()
This function returns the length of a string as a integer value:
'''
#Syntax:
str = "Hi Python !"   
#Here, if we check the type of the variable str using a Python script
print(type(str))# then it will print a string (str)   

#Creating String in Python
'''
We can create a string by enclosing the characters in "single-quotes"
or "double- quotes". Python also provides "triple-quotes" to represent 
the string, but it is generally used for multiline string or 
"docstring|s.
'''
#Using single quotes  
str1 = 'Hello Python'  
print(str1)  
#Using double quotes  
str2 = "Hello Python"  
print(str2)  
#Using triple quotes  
str3 = '''''Triple quotes are generally used for  
    represent the multiline or 
    docstring'''   
print(str3)  

#Strings indexing and splitting
'''
Like other languages, the indexing of the Python strings starts 
from 0. For example, The string "HELLO" is indexed as given in the 
below figure.
str="HELLO"
 +---+---+---+---+---+
 | H | E | L | L | o | 
 +---+---+---+---+---+
   0   1   2   3   4      
  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1
str[0]='H'
str[1]='E'
str[2]='L'
str[3]='L'
str[4]='O'
Reverse
str[-1]='O'
str[-2]='L'
str[-3]='L'
str[-4]='E'
str[-5]='H'
'''
str = "HELLO"  
print(str[0])  
print(str[1])  
print(str[2])  
print(str[3])  
print(str[4]) 
print(str[-1])
print(str[-2])
print(str[-3])
print(str[-4])
print(str[-5])
# It returns the IndexError because 6th index doesn't exist  
print(str[6])

#String Operator
'''

Operator	Description
+	It is known as concatenation operator used to join the strings 
        given either side of the operator.
*	It is known as repetition operator. It concatenates the multiple 
        copies of the same string.
[]	It is known as slice operator. It is used to access the sub-strings 
        of a particular string.
[:]	It is known as range slice operator. It is used to access the 
        characters from the specified range.
in	It is known as membership operator. It returns if a particular 
        sub-string is present in the specified string.
not in	It is also a membership operator and does the exact reverse of in. 
        It returns true if a particular substring is not present in the 
        specified string.
r/R	It is used to specify the raw string. Raw strings are used in the 
        cases where we need to print the actual meaning of escape characters such as "C://python". To define any string as a raw string, the character r or R is followed by the string.
%	It is used to perform string formatting. It makes use of the 
        format specifiers used in C programming like %d or %f to map 
        their values in python. We will discuss how formatting is 
        done in python.

#Consider the following example to understand the real use of 
# Python operators.
str = "Hello"     
str1 = " world"    
print(str*3) # prints HelloHelloHello    
print(str+str1)# prints Hello world

#Python String Formatting
'''
Escape Sequence
Let's suppose we need to write the text as - 
They said, "Hello what's going on?"- the given statement can be written 
in single quotes or double quotes but it will raise the SyntaxError 
as it contains both single and double-quotes.
Example
Consider the following example to understand the real use of Python 
operators.
str = "They said, "Hello what's going on?""  
print(str)  
'''
str = "They said, "Hello what's going on?""  
print(str)  
#Solution:
str = '''"They said, "Hello what's going on?""'''  
print(str) 
'''
We can use the triple quotes to accomplish this problem but Python provides
the escape sequence.
The backslash(/) symbol denotes the escape sequence. The backslash can be 
followed by a special character and it interpreted differently. The single 
quotes inside the string must be escaped. We can apply the same as in the 
double quotes.
'''
#Example
# using triple quotes  
print('''''They said, "What's there?"''')  
  
# escaping single quotes  
print('They said, "What\'s going on?"')  
  
# escaping double quotes  
print("They said, \"What's going on?\"")

#The format() method
'''
The format() method is the most flexible and useful method in formatting 
strings. The curly braces {} are used as the placeholder in the string 
and replaced by the format() method argument. Let's have a look at the 
iven an example:
'''
# Using Curly braces  
print("{} and {} both are the best friend".format("Hamza","Hashim"))  
#Positional Argument  
print("{1} and {0} best players ".format("Hashim","Hamza"))  
#Keyword Argument  
print("{a},{b},{c}".format(a = "Hashim", b = "Hamza", c = "Sir Farooq"))  

#Python String Formatting Using % Operator
'''
Python allows us to use the format specifiers used in C's printf 
statement. The format specifiers in Python are treated in the same 
way as they are treated in C. However, Python provides an additional 
operator %, which is used as an interface between the format specifiers 
and their values. In other words, we can say that it binds the format 
specifiers to the values.
'''
Integer = 10
Float = 1.290    
String = "Hamza"    
print("""Hi I am Integer ... My value is %d
Hi I am float ... My value is %f
Hi I am string ... My value is %s"""%(Integer,Float,String))

## Code structure
```python
    
    from turtle import *
title('Sixteen Petals Flower')
setworldcoordinates(-2000,-2000,2000,2000)

def draw_flower(x,y,tilt,radius):
    up()
    goto(x,y)
    down()
    seth(tilt-45)
    circle(radius,90)
    left(90)
    circle(radius,90)

for tilt in range(0,360,30):
    draw_flower(0,0,tilt,1000)
    
    done()
    
   ``` 
    
   # Explaination:
    
  ##  1. Import and Setup:

- Imports the turtle module: from turtle import *
- Sets the title of the drawing window: title('Sixteen Petals Flower')
- Sets the world coordinates to a larger range: setworldcoordinates(-2000,-2000,2000,2000) This allows for more space to draw the flower.
## 2. Flower Drawing Function:

- Defines a function draw_flower(x, y, tilt, radius):
 Moves the turtle to position (x, y): up(), goto(x, y), down()
 Sets the heading based on tilt: seth(tilt - 45)
- Draws two connected quarter circles to create a petal: circle(radius, 90), left(90), circle(radius, 90)
## 3. Drawing Loop:

- Loops through tilt values from 0 to 355 with a step of 30: for tilt in range(0, 360, 30):
- Calls the draw_flower function with appropriate arguments for each petal: draw_flower(0, 0, tilt, 1000)
## 4. Keeps Window Open:

- Keeps the drawing window open until it's manually closed: done()


## In summary:

The code uses the turtle library to create a 16-petal flower.
It defines a function to draw a single petal with a specific tilt and radius.
It uses a loop to create 16 petals, each with a different tilt, resulting in a circular pattern.
The world coordinates are set to a larger range to accommodate the flower's size.

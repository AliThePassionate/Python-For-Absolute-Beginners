## Code structure
```python
    # Import the turtle library for
# drawing the required curve
from turtle  import *

# Set the background color as black,
# pensize as 2 and speed of drawing
# curve as 10(relative)
Screen().bgcolor('black')
pensize(2)
speed(10)

# Iterate six times in total
for i in range(6):

	# Choose your color combination
	for color in ('red', 'magenta', 'blue',
				'cyan', 'green', 'white',
				'yellow'):
		color(color)

		# Draw a circle of chosen size, 100 here
		circle(100)

		# Move 10 pixels left to draw another circle
		left(10)

	# Hide the cursor(or turtle) which drew the circle
	hideturtle()
done()
   ``` 
    
   # Explaination:

Here's a breakdown of the code's details:

## 1. Import Turtle Module:

- from turtle import *: Imports the turtle graphics library, providing tools to create visual elements and animations.
## 2. Set Drawing Environment:

- Screen().bgcolor('black'): Sets the background color of the drawing screen to black.
- pensize(2): Sets the thickness of the lines drawn by the turtle to 2 pixels.
- speed(10): Adjusts the drawing speed of the turtle to a relatively fast pace (10).
##3. Main Loop for Multiple Circles:

- for i in range(6):: Iterates the code block six times, creating a total of six sets of circles.
## 4. Color Loop for Each Set:

- for color in ('red', 'magenta', 'blue', 'cyan', 'green', 'white', 'yellow'):: Iterates through a list of colors, drawing a circle in each color.
##5. Drawing Circles:

- color(color): Sets the current drawing color to the color specified in the loop.
- circle(100): Draws a circle with a radius of 100 pixels.
- left(10): Rotates the turtle 10 degrees counterclockwise, positioning it for the next circle.
## 6. Hide Turtle:

- hideturtle(): Hides the turtle from the screen, leaving only the drawn circles visible.
## 7. Keep Window Open:

- done(): Holds the turtle graphics window open until it's manually closed.
